## About Me 👋
I am a student studying Economics, Data Science, Sustainability, and Korean at the University of Notre Dame. My work in data science consists of my coursework in the data science minor and my personal interests in combining economics, data science, and sustainability. I am excited to be learning applicable data science techniques and advancing my coding skills as I progress in my coursework.
